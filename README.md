#  TheFork challenge

## Introduction

Congratulation you just joined a small startup that wants to "catch em' all" ;)!
It's a small startup, they didn't have any iOS developer to bootstrap their app so it has been made by Antonio the summer intern.

Currently the app is composed with the following:

- MVVM
- Service modules
  
The following features:

- Listing of pokemon [their API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#wrap)
- Detail of a selected beer

-- 

## First step:

Antonio will be soon leaving the company since the intership will be over soon, what feedback could you give about the project ?

This can be written in the readme you will provide with your project or as a side document.

**Good things:**

- ...
- ...
- ...

**Issues:**

- ...
- ...

## Second step:

Now that you've found some amelioration that can be made on the project and since you are a true iOS software engineer here is the **requirements**:

- Create unit tests
- Add sorting and filtering
- Improve existing code base and project
- Create a README with the technical choices, potential difficulties, etc.

Optional features ideas that can be integrated:

- Implement the details page in SwiftUI
- Implement pagination of the list

## FAQ

> What is a deadline ?

This can vary depending on each candidate, we prefer a "one week" timing period.

> How much time should I spend on this project ?

This project can be achieved in 2h ~ 4h depending on your seniority level.

On average our candidates spend between 4h ~ 8h.

> Can I change the whole architecture to something else than MVVM ?

Yes, but please be advised that it still needs to fufill **ALL** of the requirements.

If you choose to do so, we are expecting to read on why you decided to do so.
